# Eat Your Veggies

Welcome to the digital garden for veggie enthusiasts! This lightweight website is a playful homage to the love of vegetables, inspired by the nostalgic charm of 8-bit video games like Stardew Valley and Pokémon.

## Project Goals:
1. Celebrate the importance of incorporating vegetables into daily life.
2. Share fun, sassy, and delightful veggie knowledge.
3. Provide a Stardew Valley-inspired visual and interactive experience.

## Structure:
- **Home Page (`index.html`)**:
    - Describes the joys and benefits of veggies in a creative way.
    - Serves as a navigation hub.
- **`why-veggies.html`**:
    - A sassy, informative page covering health benefits, nutrition notes, and myth-busting about vegetables.
- **`veggie-guide.html`**:
    - Practical picks, prep tips, and swaps to make veggies easy and fun.
- **`recipes.html`**:
    - Three quick, tasty recipes to help you add more vegetables to your meals.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Future Plans:
- Add more visually engaging interactive features (pixel sprites, more Bitaminds, and mini-games).
- Expand the veggie guide and recipes section with rich content.

## Visual & Interactive Notes
- This site uses an 8-bit inspired theme (fonts and pixel sprites) for an old-school game feel — think Stardew Valley / Pokémon vibes.
- Sprites were recently updated to be larger and cuter (still pixel-inspired but scaled for clarity and charm).
- Bitaminds now have **sprite settings**: animation mode (smooth / pixel 2-frame / off) and sprite size (small / medium / large). Settings are saved to your browser.
- 'Bitaminds' are a playful, collectible concept that maps vegetables to small 'power-ups' for learning and fun.
